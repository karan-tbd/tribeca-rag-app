## 📋 Manual Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Linear Project
1. Go to Linear → Create New Project
2. Set name: "RAG Framework App v1"
3. Set key: "RAG"
4. Set timeline: Today + 6 weeks
5. Add yourself as sole member and lead

### Step 2: Configure Workflow & Labels
1. **Workflow:** Create single workflow with 8 states (Backlog → Spec → Ready → In Progress → Blocked → In Review → QA → Done)
2. **Labels:** Add 8 labels with appropriate colors:
   - frontend (blue)
   - backend (green)
   - infra (orange)
   - evals (purple)
   - retrieval (teal)
   - auth (red)
   - observability (yellow)
   - docs (gray)

### Step 3: Add Custom Fields
1. **Component** (Select): ingestion, retrieval, generation, evals, sessions, dashboard, persistence, security
2. **Estimate** (Select): XS (1), S (2), M (3), L (5), XL (8), XXL (13)
3. **Risk** (Select): Low, Medium, High
4. **Acceptance** (Text): For detailed acceptance criteria

### Step 4: Create Issue Templates
Copy templates from `linear-project-setup.md` into Linear's template system:
- Feature Template
- Chore Template
- Bug Template
- Spike/Research Template
- Prompt Template

### Step 5: Create Epics
Create 8 epics as milestones with descriptions and timelines from the setup document.

### Step 6: Import Issues
Create all 19 issues using detailed specifications from `linear-issues-detailed.md`:
- Copy title, description, acceptance criteria
- Set epic assignment, labels, component, estimate, risk
- Set dependencies between issues

### Step 7: Set Up Sprints
1. Create 3 sprints (2 weeks each)
2. Assign issues to appropriate sprints
3. Set sprint goals and deliverables

### Step 8: Create Saved Views
Set up 5 saved views with appropriate filters for efficient project management.
